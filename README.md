# Modeling and Analysis of the Sodium Thiosulfate-Hydrogen Peroxide Reaction: A Comprehensive Study on Multiplicity, Stability, and Sensitivity Analysis
## 1) Background and rationale for analysis

The sodium thiosulfate-hydrogen peroxide reaction has been the subject of numerous studies due to its intriguing. This reaction involves the interaction between sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), resulting in the formation of various products and exhibiting unique characteristics. In this study, we investigate the reaction in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) equipped with a cooling jacket. The cooling jacket is crucial in controlling the temperature of the reaction system, ensuring efficient heat removal, and preventing thermal instability. The CSTR consists of a well-mixed tank that receives a continuous inflow of reactants while simultaneously removing the products. The reactants, sodium thiosulfate and hydrogen peroxide, are introduced into the reactor at specified flow rates. The cooling jacket surrounding the reactor vessel facilitates heat transfer and maintains the reaction temperature within a desired range. 

### a) About the reaction 

The hydrogen peroxide sodium thiosulfate reaction is a chemical reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3). When hydrogen peroxide is mixed with sodium thiosulfate, a vigorous bubbling and frothing occurs. This reaction produces water, sodium sulfate, and oxygen gas as byproducts. It is an exothermic reaction, meaning that it releases heat energy. Overall, the hydrogen peroxide sodium thiosulfate reaction is a fascinating display of chemical transformation, often used in experiments or demonstrations due to its visually captivating nature.
